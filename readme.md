i was just bored ðŸ’€
use python skull.py --help for more info

highly recommend usage of a string no more than 5 characters long for testing
there is a 1 in 141,167,095,653,376 chance by my calculations of randomly hitting the string 'helloworld' if we randomly sample characters from lower case ascii letters only
doing that many iterations on my pc on a single thread would take approximately 5 to 5.5 years ðŸ’€
will try and add multithreading in a future update
