i was just bored ðŸ’€

use python skull.py --help for more info

highly recommend usage of a string no more than 5 characters long for testing<br />
there is a 1 in 141,167,095,653,376 chance by my calculations of randomly hitting the string 'helloworld' if we randomly sample characters from lower case ascii letters only<br />
doing that many iterations on my pc on a single thread would take approximately 5 to 5.5 years ðŸ’€<br />
with the addition of multiprocessing it should take approximately 1 to 1.25 years <br />
definitely need to make this in c++ because python's multi-threading is useless, not to mention how slow python is in general
